# Tandem Browser TODO

> Internal development backlog for active and upcoming work.
> Historical release summaries belong in `CHANGELOG.md`.
> Architecture and product context belong in `PROJECT.md`.

Last updated: March 8, 2026

## Purpose

- Keep this file forward-looking.
- Track active priorities, maintenance tasks, and unresolved questions.
- Avoid turning this file into a second changelog or a historical roadmap.

## Current Snapshot

- Current app version: `0.45.3`
- The codebase scope is larger than this backlog summary and includes major subsystems such as `sidebar`, `workspaces`, `pinboards`, `sync`, `headless`, and `sessions`.
- Scheduled browsing already exists in baseline form via `WatchManager` and the `/watch/*` API routes.
- Session isolation already exists in baseline form via `SessionManager` and the `/sessions/*` API routes.
- `TODO.md` is the active engineering backlog; `docs/internal/ROADMAP.md` and `docs/internal/STATUS.md` are historical snapshots, not the day-to-day source of truth.

## Current Priorities

### Product Features

- [ ] `WebSocket /watch/live` for live watch updates
- [ ] Show a notification when the Wingman panel is closed and Wingman replies
- [ ] Google Photos upload support for screenshots; the settings UI exists, but the upload path does not
- [ ] Configurable quick links on the new tab page; links are still hardcoded
- [ ] Configurable diff modes for watches beyond SHA-256 hash comparison
- [ ] HAR export for the network inspector
- [ ] Design and build the `Personal News` experience; the sidebar currently has a placeholder slot, but the actual panel and feed model are not implemented yet
- [ ] Full browsing session recording and replay; current code has behavior replay and audio recording, but not an end-to-end session recorder

### Maintenance Sweep

- [ ] Fix the `Snoze` typo in `docs/research/opera-browser-research.md` and do a quick spell-check in the same tab-snoozing section
- [x] Harden extension update version comparison in `src/extensions/update-checker.ts`; `isNewerVersion()` now handles uneven segment lengths and prerelease suffixes such as `1.2.3-beta`
- [x] Add focused tests for extension version comparison edge cases in `src/extensions/tests/`, including `1.2` vs `1.2.0`, `1.10.0` vs `1.9.9`, and pre-release suffix input

### Codebase Hygiene

- [x] Split `src/main.ts` bootstrap and teardown wiring into dedicated `src/bootstrap/` modules so manager composition stops growing in one file
- [x] Extract the largest shell surfaces out of `shell/index.html` and `shell/css/main.css` so sidebar logic, modal helpers, and stylesheet sections stop living in single inline or monolithic files
- [x] Split the Wingman and ClaroNote renderer surfaces out of `shell/js/main.js` into dedicated shell modules with explicit shared state instead of file-scope coupling
- [x] Extract browser tools (`bookmarks`, `history`, `find`, `voice`, `settings`, `screenshot`) out of `shell/js/main.js` into `shell/js/browser-tools.js` with the shared renderer bridge as the explicit integration surface
- [x] Extract tab rendering, navigation, zoom, and shared renderer state out of `shell/js/main.js` into `shell/js/tabs.js`, and keep active-tab coordination explicit through the renderer bridge
- [x] Extract the draw overlay surface out of `shell/js/main.js` into `shell/js/draw.js` so annotation state, screenshot compositing, and draw-mode lifecycles stop sharing a file with window chrome and shortcuts
- [x] Replace the last mixed shell entrypoint with dedicated `shell/js/window-chrome.js` and `shell/js/shortcut-router.js` modules so `main.js` is no longer needed as a catch-all shell loader
- [ ] Investigate the remaining 1Password MV3 service-worker startup noise (`DidStartWorkerFail ...: 5` and policy calculation errors) and determine whether it affects any real user-facing behavior; the old `__tandemExtensionHeaders` background error is fixed, and current manual checks indicate the extension still works for normal use
- [x] Add GitHub Actions verification for `npm run verify` on pushes and pull requests

## Later

### Distribution and UX

- [ ] Full multi-profile UX on top or the existing `SessionManager` isolation model
- [ ] Auto-updater integration (`electron-updater`); `release/` still contains an old `0.1.0` manifest
- [ ] Production-ready DMG build for macOS with current naming and metadata
- [ ] AppImage build for Linux
- [ ] Documentation site
- [ ] Firefox import

### Stealth and Browser Fidelity

- [ ] Proxy support (SOCKS5 or HTTP, per-tab or global)
- [ ] User-facing request interception and header rewrite rules
- [ ] TLS / JA3 fingerprint matching
- [ ] Screen resolution spoofing
- [ ] Battery API masking
- [ ] Geolocation spoofing

## Open Questions

- [ ] Define what `Agent Tools Phase 4` should be; `docs/agent-tools/STATUS.md` still marks it as the next implementation target
- [ ] Define what `Security Fixes Phase 2` should be; `docs/security-fixes/STATUS.md` still leaves this open
- [ ] Re-validate the memory leak finding from `docs/archive/AUDIT-REPORT.md` against the current `app.on('web-contents-created')` lifecycle
- [ ] Decide whether the tab registration race from `docs/archive/AUDIT-REPORT.md` is now fully resolved or should be closed out explicitly in docs; the current code has `pendingTabRegister` plus a renderer rename flow

## Recently Completed

- [x] Password manager: local SQLite + AES-256-GCM vault, master password, autofill, password generator, and `GET /passwords/suggest`
- [x] Behavioral learning models: profile compiler, typing timing model, mouse trajectory replay, and fallback humanization behavior
- [x] SPA rendering fix for `/page-content` on dynamic pages; see `docs/archive/plans/spa-rendering-bug.md`
