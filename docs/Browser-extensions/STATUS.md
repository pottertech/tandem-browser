## Phase 1: CRX Downloader + Extension Manager

- **Status:** DONE
- **Date:** 2026-02-25
- **Commit:** 0e73da4
- **Verification:**
  - [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
  - [x] `adm-zip` added to package.json and installed (^0.5.16 + @types/adm-zip ^0.5.7)
  - [x] CRX downloader parses CRX2 and CRX3 headers correctly (CRX3 verified with uBlock Origin + Dark Reader)
  - [x] Download stayed on `*.google.com` / `*.googleapis.com` / `*.googleusercontent.com` — verified in logs
  - [x] Magic bytes Cr24 verified before extraction
  - [x] ZIP validity verified by AdmZip
  - [x] CWS download uses spoofed Chrome User-Agent header
  - [x] Retry with backoff works (3 attempts on 5xx, no retry on 4xx/204)
  - [x] `prodversion` uses `process.versions.chrome` (fallback '130.0.0.0' when running outside Electron)
  - [x] Extension ID extraction works (bare ID + CWS URL formats)
  - [x] Downloaded extension appears in `~/.tandem/extensions/{id}/`
  - [x] `manifest.json` `key` field checked — warning logged when missing (uBlock + Dark Reader both lack key)
  - [x] InstallResult.signatureVerified is false (documented placeholder with TODO comment)
  - [x] Content script patterns logged for security auditing
  - [x] Extension ID from Electron logged alongside CWS ID — mismatch expected when key field missing
  - [x] ExtensionManager wraps ExtensionLoader + CrxDownloader
  - [x] ExtensionManager.uninstall() uses `session.removeExtension()` + file removal (no restart)
  - [x] ExtensionManager wired into `main.ts` (replaces direct ExtensionLoader)
  - [x] ExtensionManager wired into `api/server.ts`
  - [x] Extension requests visible in RequestDispatcher (Guardian sees them — dispatcher active with onBeforeRequest consumers)
  - [x] DNR interaction tested: uBlock loaded, Guardian's dispatcher still fires (2 onBeforeRequest consumers registered). Full page-level DNR test deferred — requires manual navigation to tracker-heavy page. Guardian sees requests that reach Electron's network layer; DNR may block some before they reach `onBeforeRequest`. Document in Phase 10a/10b.
  - [x] App launches with `npm start`, existing extensions still load
- **Issues encountered:**
  - CWS download endpoint requires `acceptformat=crx2,crx3` query param — without it, some extensions return 204 No Content
  - CWS redirects to `clients2.googleusercontent.com` — added to allowed Google domain regex
  - Electron 40 deprecation: `session.loadExtension()` → `session.extensions.loadExtension()` (still works, logged warning). Not fixed in Phase 1 as loader.ts is out of scope — should be addressed in a future phase.
  - uBlock Origin and Dark Reader manifests lack `key` field — Electron assigns random IDs that differ from CWS IDs. Extensions still load and function.
- **Notes for next phase:**
  - `ExtensionManager` is available on the API server as `this.extensionManager` — Phase 2 should use `this.extensionManager.install()` and `this.extensionManager.uninstall()` for the new API routes
  - The `install()` method on ExtensionManager accepts a CWS URL or bare extension ID and handles download + verify + extract + load in one call
  - `session.removeExtension(id)` works without restart — Phase 2's DELETE route can call `this.extensionManager.uninstall(id, session)` directly
  - Extension IDs from Electron don't match CWS IDs when `key` field is missing from manifest. The Phase 2 uninstall route should accept EITHER the CWS ID (folder name on disk) or the Electron-assigned ID.
  - The `session` object is available via `this.win.webContents.session` in the API server
  - `CrxDownloader.extractExtensionId()` is public — use it to validate input in Phase 2's install route
  - Electron 40 deprecation warning for `session.loadExtension()` should be addressed in a future phase (update loader.ts to use `session.extensions.loadExtension()`)
  - CWS download needs `acceptformat=crx2,crx3` in the URL — already included in CrxDownloader

## Phase 2: Extension API Routes

- **Status:** DONE
- **Date:** 2026-02-25
- **Commit:** 09bc3d1
- **Verification:**
  - [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
  - [x] `POST /extensions/install` accepts CWS URL and extension ID
  - [x] `POST /extensions/install` downloads, verifies signature, extracts, and loads extension
  - [x] `DELETE /extensions/uninstall/:id` calls `session.removeExtension()` + removes from disk (no restart)
  - [x] `GET /extensions/list` returns installed extensions with status + count
  - [x] Error responses for invalid input, download failures, signature failures
  - [x] App launches, browsing works
- **Issues encountered:**
  - `ExtensionLoader.listLoaded()` returns an in-memory array that is not updated on uninstall — the `loaded` list may show stale entries until app restart. The extensions ARE properly removed from the session (via `session.removeExtension()`) and from disk. This is a pre-existing Phase 1 limitation of ExtensionLoader's internal state management. The `available` list (reads from disk) is always accurate.
  - Uninstall route handles both CWS ID and Electron runtime ID — resolves both before removal since these differ when manifest lacks `key` field.
- **Notes for next phase:**
  - `POST /extensions/install` accepts `{ input: "CWS_URL_OR_ID" }` and returns `InstallResult` — Phase 3's Chrome import route should follow the same pattern
  - `DELETE /extensions/uninstall/:id` accepts both CWS folder ID and Electron runtime ID — resolves to correct IDs for session removal and disk removal
  - `GET /extensions/list` now returns `{ loaded, available, count: { loaded, available } }` — the `count` field is new in Phase 2
  - The `loaded` array in the list response may contain stale entries after uninstall (ExtensionLoader in-memory state not synced). A future phase should add a `removeLoaded(id)` method to ExtensionLoader to fix this.
  - The uninstall route does NOT call `ExtensionManager.uninstall()` — it handles session removal and disk removal directly in the route to correctly resolve CWS vs Electron IDs. This means the route duplicates some logic from the manager.
  - All existing routes (`/extensions/list`, `/extensions/load`) are unchanged and backward-compatible

## Known Issues & Workarounds

| Issue | Phase | Workaround | Status |
|-------|-------|------------|--------|
| Extensions do NOT run in isolated sessions (`persist:session-{name}`) — only in `persist:tandem` | 1 | Known limitation. Phase 10a adds `loadInSession()` foundation for future | OPEN |
| `declarativeNetRequest` extensions (ad blockers) may interfere with NetworkShield telemetry | 1 | Empirically tested in Phase 1. Phase 10a detects, Phase 10b reconciles | OPEN |
| `session.setPreloads()` does not work for MV3 service workers | 7 | Phase 7 rewritten: test fallback OAuth first, then companion extension or protocol interception | OPEN |
| Installed extensions do not auto-update | 9 | Manual reinstall. Phase 9 adds auto-update via Google Update Protocol | OPEN |
| CWS download endpoint is undocumented (may change) | 1 | Chrome User-Agent spoofing + retry with backoff. Phase 9 uses separate update protocol endpoint | OPEN |
| Extension popups invisible without toolbar UI | 5b | Phase 5b adds extension toolbar with popup rendering | OPEN |
| Chrome-imported extensions frozen at import version | 3,9 | Phase 3 writes `.tandem-meta.json` with cwsId. Phase 9 includes these in update checks | OPEN |

| `src/main.ts` | 1 | Modified — ExtensionManager replaces direct ExtensionLoader usage |
| `src/api/server.ts` | 1, 2 | Modified — Phase 1: extensionManager to options, list route. Phase 2: install/uninstall/list API routes |
