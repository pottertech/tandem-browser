## Current State

**Next phase to implement:** Phase 5
**Last completed phase:** Phase 4
**Overall status:** IN PROGRESS

## Phase 1: Triviale Safe Fixes

- **Status:** DONE
- **Date:** 2026-02-26
- **Commit:** 4b29320
- **Verification:**
  - [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors (pre-existing errors in gateway test file are OK)
  - [x] Guardian backpressure `&&` → `||` (guardian.ts line 53)
  - [x] SecurityDB closed on quit (security-manager.ts destroy method) — was already present
  - [x] productName changed to "Tandem Browser" (package.json line 47)
  - [x] DEBUG console.logs removed from onboarding (shell/index.html) — 17 lines removed
  - [x] Hardcoded 'levelsio' removed (x-scout.ts line 262)
  - [x] cookieCounts eviction added (guardian.ts)
  - [x] focusByIndex uses listTabs() (tabs/manager.ts line 273)
  - [x] SSE token via header instead of query param (mcp/server.ts line 730)
  - [ ] App launches with `npm start`, browsing works — needs manual test
- **Issues encountered:** Fix 1.2 (SecurityDB close) was already implemented — `this.db.close()` already existed on line 949 of security-manager.ts
- **Notes for next phase:** Phase 2 can start immediately. The `escapeHtml()` function exists at ~line 2568 in shell/index.html. Console.error lines in onboarding were cleaned up (removed `[DEBUG]` prefix) but kept as legitimate error checks.

## Phase 2: XSS Fixes + Crash Handler

- **Status:** DONE
- **Date:** 2026-02-26
- **Commit:** 2c05e9d
- **Verification:**
  - [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
  - [x] Activity feed uses escapeHtml() for all dynamic text (shell/index.html)
  - [x] Bookmark names escaped (shell/index.html + shell/bookmarks.html)
  - [x] Download filenames escaped (shell/index.html) — 3 locations fixed
  - [x] Chat message `name` field escaped (shell/index.html)
  - [x] uncaughtException handler added (main.ts)
  - [x] unhandledRejection handler added (main.ts)
  - [ ] App launches, browse to a page with special chars in title — no XSS (needs manual test)
  - [ ] All Phase 1 fixes still work (needs manual test)
- **Issues encountered:** escapeHtml() was scoped inside chatRouter IIFE — added a global escapeHtml() at the top of the main script block so activity feed, bookmarks, and screenshot code can also use it. The chatRouter-internal version shadows the global one (identical implementation, no behavior change).
- **Notes for next phase:** Phase 3 (Auth Hardening) can start immediately. The global escapeHtml() is now available throughout shell/index.html for any future innerHTML usage.

## Phase 3: Auth Hardening

- **Status:** DONE
- **Date:** 2026-02-26
- **Commit:** 2118d75
- **Verification:**
  - [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
  - [x] Requests without Origin header now require Bearer token
  - [x] Shell (file:// origin) still works without token
  - [x] `/screenshot?save=` validates path to allowed directory
  - [x] `/extensions/identity/auth` requires authentication
  - [x] `curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/execute-js` returns 401 (no token)
  - [ ] MCP server still works (reads token from ~/.tandem/api-token) — needs manual test
  - [x] App launches, all panel features work
  - [x] All Phase 1+2 fixes still work
- **Issues encountered:** None
- **Notes for next phase:** Phase 4 can start immediately. All unauthenticated requests now return 401 unless from file:// or localhost origins. The `/status` health check endpoint remains unauthenticated (by design). External tools (curl, scripts, MCP) must use `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

## Phase 4: Init & Lifecycle Fixes

- **Status:** DONE
- **Date:** 2026-02-26
- **Commit:** 1d9df8e
- **Verification:**
  - [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
  - [x] macOS `activate` handler uses async/await
  - [x] IPC cleanup list is complete (added 7 missing handlers: navigate, go-back, go-forward, reload, get-page-content, get-page-status, execute-js)
  - [x] `tab-register` IPC is queued when tabManager not yet ready (early listener + pending processing)
  - [x] RequestDispatcher uses stable handler (no reattach mid-flight, sorts dynamically per-request)
  - [x] BehaviorObserver not double-destroyed (nulled after destroy in closed handler)
  - [ ] App launches, close all windows, click dock icon — app recovers (macOS) — needs manual test
  - [x] All Phase 1+2+3 fixes still work (API status, auth 401, security status all verified)
- **Issues encountered:** None
- **Notes for next phase:** Phase 5 can start immediately. The `is-window-maximized` IPC handler error in console is pre-existing (not related to Phase 4 changes). The RequestDispatcher now sorts consumer arrays on every request callback — negligible cost for 3-5 element arrays.

  - [ ] All Phase 1+2+3+4+5 fixes still work
- **Issues encountered:** —
- **Notes for next phase:** —
