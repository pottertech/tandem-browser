# Security Hardening — START HERE

> **Date:** 2026-03-07
> **Status:** Ready
> **Goal:** Strengthen Tandem's security model so the local API, Gatekeeper,
> runtime monitoring, outbound controls, and extension trust boundaries provide
> better protection for both Robin and OpenClaw
> **Order:** Phase 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6

## Why This Track Exists

Tandem already has meaningful browser security controls, but several important
boundaries still rely on permissive assumptions:

- loopback access is trusted too broadly
- uncertain cases default to allow
- some deeper monitoring follows the attached tab instead of the full browser
- outbound protection is partly heuristic
- extensions are powerful but not yet fully scoped as privileged actors

This track fixes those gaps in an order that preserves context and limits the
risk of breaking the browser.

## Architecture In 30 Seconds

```text
Caller -> Auth boundary -> Guardian policy -> Gatekeeper decision path
      -> Per-tab monitoring -> Outbound controls -> Containment action
```

Each phase improves one layer without forcing a full-stack rewrite.

### Read For All Phases

| File | Why |
|------|-----|
| `AGENTS.md` | workflow rules, anti-detection constraints, commit/report expectations |
| `PROJECT.md` | product/security positioning |
| `src/main.ts` | app lifecycle, tab wiring, manager lifecycle |
| `src/api/server.ts` | API auth model and route registration |
| `src/security/security-manager.ts` | security subsystem orchestration |
| `src/security/guardian.ts` | primary request policy and enforcement |

## Hard Rules For This Track

1. **No page-visible security UI**: all warnings, blocks, and recovery UX must
   live in the shell
2. **No implicit widening of trust**: every new exception must be documented and
   justified
3. **Fail closed only where the product can explain it**: if a request is held
   or blocked, Robin needs a clear path to understand what happened
4. **Function names over line numbers**: always reference concrete
   functions/classes
5. **Each phase must leave the browser working**: no "temporary broken state"
   phases

## Quick Status Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:8765/status
npx tsc
git status
npx vitest run
```

---

## Session Start Protocol

Every new security-hardening session should begin the same way:

1. `git pull origin main`
2. Read `AGENTS.md`
3. Read this file from top to bottom
4. Read the `Progress Log` section below
5. Identify the first phase whose status is not `Complete`
6. Open only that phase file
7. Verify the previous phase handoff notes and remaining risks before coding

If the docs and the actual repo state disagree, stop and report the mismatch
before making changes.

---

## Session Completion Protocol

Every phase session must do all of the following before it ends:

1. Complete the phase end-to-end
2. Run `npm run compile`
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
4. Bump `package.json` with a patch release
5. Update the `Progress Log` in this file
6. Include:
   - status
   - date
   - commit hash
   - summary of completed work
   - remaining risks for the next phase
7. Commit in English
8. Push to `origin main`

If the phase is too large or blocked, the session must update this file with a
clear blocked state and explain exactly what stopped progress.

---

## Phase Selection Rule

Future sessions should **not** guess which phase to start.

They must:

- read this file
- check the `Progress Log`
- select the first phase in sequence whose status is one of:
  - `Ready`
  - `In progress`
  - `Blocked`
- continue from there

They must **not** skip ahead to a later phase unless this file explicitly says
the dependency order changed.

---

## Progress Tracking Rules

After each phase:

- update `CHANGELOG.md`
- update this document if the sequence or assumptions change
- note any newly discovered risks before starting the next phase
- explicitly record what still remains true, what changed, and what is now
  protected

This file exists so future sessions can restart from the documented state
instead of depending on chat context.

## Progress Log

### Phase 1 — API Auth

- Status: Complete
- Date: 2026-03-07
- Commit: 67d1464
- Summary: Replaced blanket loopback trust with an explicit caller model in `class TandemAPI`, kept `/status` public, required bearer auth for normal HTTP routes, removed query-string token auth, exported a narrow trusted-extension route allowlist, and applied the same installed-extension validation to the native messaging WebSocket upgrade path.
- Remaining risks for next phase: Gatekeeper fail-closed work must preserve the trusted-extension helper allowlist and the native messaging bridge while avoiding a new implicit bypass for shell/file callers.

### Phase 2 — Gatekeeper Enforcement

- Status: Ready
- Date: —
- Commit: —
- Summary: —
- Remaining risks for next phase: Existing shell/file callers are now classified but no longer auto-trusted, so Gatekeeper enforcement should assume bearer auth for shell-initiated HTTP calls unless a future internal path is explicitly designed and documented.

### Phase 3 — Per-Tab Monitoring

- Status: Waiting
- Date: —
- Commit: —
- Summary: —
- Remaining risks for next phase: —

### Phase 4 — Outbound Containment

- Status: Waiting
- Date: —
- Commit: —
- Summary: —
- Remaining risks for next phase: —

### Phase 5 — Extension Trust

- Status: Waiting
- Date: —
- Commit: —
- Summary: —
- Remaining risks for next phase: —

### Phase 6 — Containment Actions

- Status: Waiting
- Date: —
- Commit: —
- Summary: —
- Remaining risks for next phase: —
