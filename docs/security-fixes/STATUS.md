## Phase 1: Real Redirect Blocking + WS False Positive Fix

- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Date:** 2026-02-21
- **Commit:** 5fa65e0
- **Verification:**
  - [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
  - [ ] `ws://127.0.0.1:18789/` no longer logs `unknown-ws-endpoint` events in DB
  - [ ] Navigate to a URL that redirects to a blocklisted domain → tab does NOT navigate to destination
  - [ ] `redirect-blocked` event appears in DB with `actionTaken: auto_block`
  - [ ] HTTP→HTTPS redirects on same domain still work (no false positives)
  - [ ] `GET /security/status` still returns valid response (regression)
  - [ ] Browsing normal sites works without unexpected blocks (regression)
- **Issues encountered:** None
- **Notes for next phase:** Guardian:RedirectBlock consumer registered at priority 5 (before Guardian at 20). The existing checkRedirect() via onBeforeRedirect stays as observational fallback logging. HeadersReceivedConsumer now supports both `{ cancel, responseHeaders }` and raw `Record<string, string[]>` return shapes for backward compatibility.
