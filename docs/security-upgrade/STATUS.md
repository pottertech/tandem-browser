## Current State

**Next phase to implement:** Phase 5-C
**Last completed phase:** Phase 5-B
**Overall status:** IN PROGRESS

---

## Phase 0-A: Deduplicate Shared Constants

- **Status:** DONE
- **Date:** 2026-02-24
- **Commit:** 961ce5e
- **Verification:**
  - [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
  - [x] `KNOWN_TRACKERS` exported from `types.ts`, imported by `outbound-guard.ts` and `content-analyzer.ts`
  - [x] `URL_LIST_SAFE_DOMAINS` exported from `types.ts`, imported by `network-shield.ts` and `blocklists/updater.ts`
  - [x] No duplicate definitions remain
  - [x] App launches with `npm start`, browsing works
- **Issues encountered:** None
- **Notes for next phase:** `KNOWN_TRACKERS` was merged as union of both lists (outbound-guard had ~27 entries with www. prefixes and subdomains; content-analyzer had ~22 entries with base domains). The merged set has all entries from both. Note: outbound-guard uses parent-domain matching logic in `isKnownTracker()` while content-analyzer uses direct `Set.has()` — no logic was changed, only the constant was moved.

---

## Phase 0-B: Wire Cookie Count + Correlation Trigger + Blocklist Scheduling

- **Status:** DONE
- **Date:** 2026-02-24
- **Commit:** fd9496c
- **Verification:**
  - [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
  - [x] `cookie_count` in EvolutionEngine receives real values (not hardcoded 0)
  - [x] `correlateEvents()` triggered automatically (per 100 events or hourly)
  - [x] Blocklist update runs on 24-hour schedule
  - [x] `lastUpdated` timestamp persisted in DB
  - [x] App launches, browsing works
- **Issues encountered:** None
- **Notes for next phase:** Cookie counting is done in Guardian's `analyzeResponseHeaders()` for ALL resource types (before the mainFrame filter). Counts are accumulated in a `Map<string, number>` and read+reset by SecurityManager in `onPageLoaded()`. Correlation uses a re-entrancy guard (`correlationRunning`) to prevent recursive loops since correlation itself logs events. SecurityDB has an `onEventLogged` callback that SecurityManager uses to count events across all modules (Guardian, OutboundGuard, etc.) — not just events logged by SecurityManager itself. Blocklist metadata uses a simple key-value table (`blocklist_metadata`); on startup, if `lastUpdated` is missing or >24h old, an immediate async update runs.

## Phase 1: Shannon Entropy Check + MIME Whitelist

- **Status:** DONE
- **Date:** 2026-02-24
- **Commit:** a2dfa40
- **Verification:**
  - [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
  - [x] Entropy function returns correct values (~0 for "aaaa", ~7+ for random data)
  - [x] High-entropy external scripts (>6.0, >1000 chars) generate security events
  - [x] Trusted Content-Type whitelist skips body scan for media uploads
  - [x] `application/json` and `x-www-form-urlencoded` are still scanned
  - [x] Normal form submissions still trigger credential scanning
  - [x] App launches, browsing works
- **Issues encountered:** None
- **Notes for next phase:** `calculateEntropy()` is a module-level function in `script-guard.ts` (not exported — used only internally). Entropy check is async (uses `Debugger.getScriptSource` CDP call) and fires in background after the sync `analyzeScript()` completes. Only external scripts are checked (script domain != page domain), with size bounds 1000 chars to 500KB. Severity tiers: 6.0-6.5 = medium, 6.5-7.0 = high, 7.0+ = critical. MIME whitelist in OutboundGuard extracts Content-Type from multipart form-data bytes; includes a safety guard that skips the whitelist for multi-field forms (multiple `Content-Disposition` headers) to avoid missing credential exfiltration in mixed uploads. The `EventCategory` type doesn't include 'obfuscation' so entropy events use category 'script' with reason 'high-entropy-script' in details.

---

## Phase 2-A: ThreatRule Interface + Rule Set Definition

- **Status:** DONE
- **Date:** 2026-02-24
- **Commit:** ce9d1af
- **Verification:**
  - [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
  - [x] `ThreatRule`, `ThreatRuleMatch`, `ScriptAnalysisResult` interfaces exported
  - [x] `JS_THREAT_RULES` array exported with 25 rules
  - [x] All regex patterns compile without errors
  - [x] App still starts (no runtime errors)
- **Issues encountered:** None
- **Notes for next phase:** All 25 rules are in `JS_THREAT_RULES` in `types.ts`, grouped by category: 9 obfuscation + 1 evasion (silent_catch) + 6 exfiltration + 6 injection + 3 redirect. The `ThreatRule.category` union includes 'evasion' alongside the 4 main categories. `ScriptAnalysisResult.entropy` is optional (will be filled by Phase 2-B when it integrates with the existing entropy check from Phase 1). Compound proximity patterns (e.g. `cookie_to_fetch`) use `[\s\S]{0,100}` for cross-line matching within 100 chars — Phase 2-B should be aware these patterns may match across lines.

---

## Phase 2-B: Rule Engine + CDP Integration + Event Logging

- **Status:** DONE
- **Date:** 2026-02-24
- **Commit:** 4419aad
- **Verification:**
  - [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
  - [x] `analyzeScriptContent()` function exists and works
  - [x] Script source retrieved via `Debugger.getScriptSource()`
  - [x] Rule matches logged as security events with type `script-analysis`
  - [x] Critical severity events notify Gatekeeper
  - [x] Scripts > 500KB skipped
  - [x] CDP errors caught gracefully
  - [x] App launches, browsing works
- **Issues encountered:** None
- **Notes for next phase:** `analyzeScriptContent()` is a module-level function in `script-guard.ts` (not exported — used only internally). It runs all 25 `JS_THREAT_RULES` against script source and returns a `ScriptAnalysisResult` with scored matches. Score thresholds: 0=none, 1-14=low, 15-29=medium, 30-49=high, 50+=critical. The old `checkScriptEntropy()` method was replaced with `analyzeExternalScript()` which fetches CDP source once and runs both the rule engine AND entropy check. If both high entropy (>=6.0) AND rules match, the total score is boosted by 25%. Phase 1 entropy logging is preserved as a separate event. Rule engine events use `eventType: 'script-analysis'` with details containing `topMatches` (max 5). Critical detections notify Gatekeeper via `onCriticalDetection` callback wired by SecurityManager in `initGatekeeper()` — this required a small addition to `security-manager.ts` (callback wiring only, ~10 lines). The analysis only runs on external scripts (different domain than page) with length <= 500KB (`MAX_SCRIPT_SIZE`).

---

## Phase 3-A: Cross-Domain Script Correlation (DB + Logic)

- **Status:** DONE
- **Date:** 2026-02-24
- **Commit:** 249fd1a
- **Verification:**
  - [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
  - [x] Index on `script_fingerprints.script_hash` exists (`idx_script_fp_hash`)
  - [x] `getDomainsForHash()` prepared statement works
  - [x] Script on blocked domain generates `script-on-blocked-domain` event (logic verified, awaiting real-world trigger)
  - [x] Script on 5+ domains generates `widespread-script` event (logic verified, awaiting real-world trigger)
  - [x] App launches, browsing works
- **Issues encountered:** None
- **Notes for next phase:** The phase doc referenced `hash` but the actual column is `script_hash` — all SQL uses the correct column name. `correlateScriptHash()` is a synchronous private method in ScriptGuard that runs after `upsertScriptFingerprint()` in `analyzeScript()`, only when a hash is available. Blocklist access uses a callback pattern (`isDomainBlocked`) wired by SecurityManager to `NetworkShield.checkDomain()` — same pattern as `onCriticalDetection`. The blocked-domain check iterates all domains for the hash (excluding current domain) and checks each against NetworkShield (in-memory Set + DB blocklist + parent domain matching). If a blocked domain is found, a critical event is logged AND Gatekeeper is notified via `onCriticalDetection`. The widespread-script check fires at 5+ distinct domains (including current) with low severity (informational — could be CDN). `getDomainCountForHash()` is also exposed as a prepared statement for Phase 3-B's API endpoint.

---

## Phase 3-B: Normalized Hashing + API Endpoint

- **Status:** DONE
- **Date:** 2026-02-24
- **Commit:** 90fa186
- **Verification:**
  - [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
  - [x] `normalized_hash` column exists in `script_fingerprints`
  - [x] Scripts differing only in comments/whitespace produce same normalized hash
  - [x] `GET /security/scripts/correlations` returns valid JSON
  - [x] App launches, browsing works
- **Issues encountered:** None
- **Notes for next phase:** `normalizeScriptSource()` is a module-level function in `script-guard.ts` (not exported) — strips `//` and `/* */` comments, collapses whitespace, trims. Normalized hash is SHA-256 hex of the normalized source, computed in `analyzeExternalScript()` after fetching source via CDP. Stored via a separate `updateNormalizedHash()` DB method (not part of the main upsert, since the source is only available async). `correlateScriptHash()` was extended with a `hashType` parameter ('original' | 'normalized') to reuse the same blocked-domain and widespread-script logic for both hash types — normalized correlation runs in `analyzeExternalScript()` after the hash is computed. The API endpoint `GET /security/scripts/correlations` (route 33) queries `getWidespreadScripts()` which groups by `script_hash` with `HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT domain) >= 2`, returning up to 50 results sorted by domain count. For each result, domains are fetched and checked against NetworkShield blocklist. Response includes `totalTrackedScripts` and `crossDomainScripts` counts. Normalized hash is only available for external scripts (different domain than page) under 500KB — first-party scripts will have `normalized_hash = NULL`.

---

## Phase 4: CyberChef Regex Patterns Integration

- **Status:** DONE
- **Date:** 2026-02-25
- **Commit:** 724f1d8
- **Verification:**
  - [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
  - [x] URL, domain, IPv4, IPv4-octal, email regex constants in `types.ts`
  - [x] Deep source scan runs after page load
  - [x] Octal IPs detected and flagged
  - [x] Blocked URLs/domains found in page source generate events
  - [x] Scan limited to first 1MB
  - [x] App launches, browsing works
- **Issues encountered:** None
- **Notes for next phase:** `deepScanPageSource()` is a private async method on ContentAnalyzer that runs as step 8 in `analyzePage()`, after all existing DOM analysis. It gets raw page HTML via `Runtime.evaluate('document.documentElement.outerHTML')`, truncates to 1MB (`MAX_SCAN_SIZE`), then calls `scanSourceForThreats()` on the full source and again on each inline `<script>` block extracted via regex. `scanSourceForThreats()` runs URL_REGEX, DOMAIN_REGEX, and IPV4_OCTAL_REGEX — skipping matches on the current page domain to avoid self-flagging. Blocked domains found in the source log `hidden-blocked-url` events (severity high). Octal IPs log `octal-ip-evasion` events (severity medium) with the decimal equivalent in details. ContentAnalyzer uses an `isDomainBlocked` callback (same pattern as ScriptGuard) wired by SecurityManager to `NetworkShield.checkDomain()`. The regex constants (`URL_REGEX`, `DOMAIN_REGEX`, `IPV4_REGEX`, `IPV4_OCTAL_REGEX`, `EMAIL_REGEX`) are all exported from `types.ts` — `IPV4_REGEX` and `EMAIL_REGEX` are not used in the deep scan but are available for future phases. Note: `security-manager.ts` was also modified (1 line) to wire the `isDomainBlocked` callback — this is outside the stated scope of types.ts + content-analyzer.ts but was necessary for blocklist integration (same pattern used in Phase 3-A for ScriptGuard).

---

## Phase 5-A: Confidence Type System + DB Layer

- **Status:** DONE
- **Date:** 2026-02-25
- **Commit:** b273bb0
- **Verification:**
  - [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
  - [x] `AnalysisConfidence` enum exported from `types.ts`
  - [x] `confidence` column exists in events table (default 500)
  - [x] `logEvent()` accepts and stores confidence values
  - [x] Existing `logEvent()` calls still work without new parameter
  - [x] App launches, browsing works
- **Issues encountered:** None
- **Notes for next phase:** `AnalysisConfidence` is a numeric enum in `types.ts` with 7 levels: BLOCKLIST(100), CREDENTIAL_EXFIL(200), KNOWN_MALWARE_HASH(300), BEHAVIORAL(500), HEURISTIC(700), ANOMALY(800), SPECULATIVE(900). Lower = more certain. `SecurityEvent.confidence` is optional (`number | undefined`); `logEvent()` defaults to 500 (BEHAVIORAL) when not provided via `event.confidence ?? 500`. The DB column uses `INTEGER DEFAULT 500` and is added via backward-compatible `ALTER TABLE` with try/catch. All 5 event SELECT queries now include the `confidence` column, and both row mapping functions (`getRecentEvents` and `getRecentAnomalies`) map it back with `?? 500` fallback. Phase 5-B should add confidence values to all `logEvent()` calls in Guardian, OutboundGuard, and ScriptGuard using the enum values.

---

## Phase 5-B: Confidence Wiring — Guardian + OutboundGuard + ScriptGuard

- **Status:** DONE
- **Date:** 2026-02-25
- **Commit:** 2f33eca
- **Verification:**
  - [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
  - [x] All `logEvent()` calls in Guardian include confidence (16 calls, 16 confidence values)
  - [x] All `logEvent()` calls in OutboundGuard include confidence (OutboundGuard has 0 direct logEvent calls — it returns OutboundDecision objects; Guardian logs them)
  - [x] All `logEvent()` calls in ScriptGuard include confidence (10 calls, 10 confidence values)
  - [x] Events in DB have correct confidence values (not all 500) — verified code logic; only correlation/gatekeeper events fired during idle test (those are SecurityManager scope, Phase 5-C)
  - [x] App launches, browsing works
- **Issues encountered:** None
- **Notes for next phase:** OutboundGuard does NOT call `logEvent()` directly — it returns `OutboundDecision` objects to Guardian which logs them. Guardian logs outbound exfiltration blocks with `CREDENTIAL_EXFIL` (200) and outbound flags with `HEURISTIC` (700). For ScriptGuard's rule engine events, confidence varies by severity: critical/high → `HEURISTIC` (700), medium/low → `ANOMALY` (800). The `AnalysisConfidence` enum is imported from `types.ts` in both guardian.ts and script-guard.ts. Phase 5-C should wire confidence into the remaining modules (ContentAnalyzer, BehaviorMonitor, SecurityManager's own correlation/gatekeeper events) and implement the Gatekeeper routing logic (high-confidence events resolved locally, low-confidence sent to Gatekeeper).
